## Setup

Install global dependencies, if you don't have them already:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

Then, make sure you have local dependencies updated by running 

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running code

Just hit `python src/main.py` and your server will go live at `localhost:5000`
